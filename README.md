# Ivy

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.1.

This is an initial test of server side rendering on top of Angular Ivy.

The base Ivy client project was generated by

`ng new ivy --experimental-ivy`

## Build and run the Universal application

1. `npm run build:ssr`
1. `npm run serve:ssr`

Things are clearly not ready because the client side `renderComponent` is not duplicating the server
generated DOM instead of replacing it.
