- Add LICENSE
- Turn on strict flags in tsconfig
- Why is RElement not assignable to Element and vice versa?
- Renderer3Factory etc. needs deep imports
- Maybe Ivy instructions can be instructed not to append child if it found
   that the node returned from the renderer is rehydrated.
- Need to support projection when using components or elements. Need hook from
  Ivy on `elementEnd`.
- Need to support <ng-container>. It is similar to templates created for *ngIf,
  *ngFor but the content is immediately evaluated instead of at the end of the
  current view creation. We need some way in Ivy to differentiate between a
  ng-container and other kinds of embedded templates - Maybe usign a different
  comment data.
- Need to handle comment markers in ngDevMode on and off. Currently we assume
  ngDevMode is always off on the server.
- Change Ivy Element Strategy to restore properties and render with a single
  renderComponent so that rehydration is possible.
- Let the IvyStrategy take in optional Renderer3Factory as a parameter so that
  it can be reused on the server.
