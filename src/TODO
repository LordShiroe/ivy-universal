- Turn on strict flags in tsconfig
- Why is RElement not assignable to Element and vice versa?
- Maybe Ivy instructions can be instructed not to append child if it found
   that the node returned from the renderer is rehydrated.
- Need to support projection when using components or elements. Need hook from
  Ivy on `elementEnd`.
